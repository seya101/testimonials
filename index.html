                                            been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
                                            an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
                                            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
                                            12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                                            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
                                            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                                needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                                program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                                were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                                agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                                learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                                have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
                                example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                                job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                                recommend! ”
